Integration Plan: Transitioning Front-End Mockups to Django Components

Define API Routes (Views and URLs):

Determine endpoints for each template.
Create Django views and map them to URLs in urls.py.

Models to be Involved:

Handle data processing, validation, and database interaction.
Serializers:

Create Django REST Framework serializers.
Convert complex data types for rendering in JSON.

Templates Integration:

Integrate templates with Django views.
Use template tags and context variables.
WebSocket Implementation and Testing:

Implement WebSocket functionality.
Use Django Channels for asynchronous communication.
Thoroughly test WebSocket features.

Data Insertion and Retrieval:

Implement data insertion and retrieval mechanisms.
Store user input and fetch data from the database.

Testing and Debugging:

Conduct comprehensive testing of each template and functionality.
Write unit tests using Django's testing framework.
