User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as password hashing and salting.
Use a robust authentication library or framework to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and password expiration.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users only have access to authorized resources.
Regularly audit and review user permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.


Session Management:

Use secure session management practices to prevent session fixation and session hijacking attacks.
Implement session timeouts to automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.
Store session data securely and avoid client-side storage of sensitive information.


Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:

Implement CSRF tokens to protect against CSRF attacks.
Validate and verify requests to ensure that they originate from trusted sources.


Input Validation and Sanitization:

Sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
Utilize server-side validation for critical data and client-side validation for user experience improvements.
Employ whitelisting approaches for input validation to explicitly allow only safe inputs.

Content Security Policy (CSP):

Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks by controlling which resources are loaded and executed on web pages.
Define a strict CSP policy that restricts inline scripts and external resources.


Error Handling:

Customize error messages to provide minimal information to potential attackers.
Implement generic error pages to avoid revealing sensitive details about the application's structure.
