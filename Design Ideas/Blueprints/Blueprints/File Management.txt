File Management Ideas


Media Files Organization:

User-generated media files, including user avatars, uploaded images, and course materials (e.g., PDFs).
File extensions: Vary depending on the type of media (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, .mp3).
Organized within the "media" folder.

Course Material Organization:

Organize course materials into a structured hierarchy.
Use folders and subfolders to categorize materials by course, topic, and type.
Implement a naming convention for files and folders to ensure clarity and easy retrieval.


Access Control and Permissions:

Define access permissions for course materials based on user roles (students, teachers).
Ensure that only authorized users can view or edit specific files.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.


Full-Text Search:

Implement a full-text search functionality to locate specific content within documents quickly.
Use search indexing techniques for efficient searching.


File Upload and Validation:

Allow teachers to upload course materials with validation checks (e.g., file format, size).
Validate and sanitize uploaded files to prevent security vulnerabilities.
