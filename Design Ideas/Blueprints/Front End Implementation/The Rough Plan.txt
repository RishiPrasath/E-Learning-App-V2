Step 1: Generate and Refine Web Pages/Templates

Define different user types (e.g., students, teachers, administrators) and their respective roles and permissions within the eLearning platform.
Determine the specific content and features that should be displayed for each user type on the various templates.
Develop the templates with conditional logic or dynamic content rendering based on the user type.
Refine the templates to ensure that the content displayed aligns with the roles and permissions of the logged-in user.

Step 2: Integrate Templates into the eLearning Django Project

Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms within the Django project to identify the user type upon login.
Utilize Django's built-in authentication system or custom authentication logic to authenticate users and determine their user type.
Modify the Django views for each template to dynamically render content based on the authenticated user's type.

Step 3: Prioritize Template Development

Consider the user type-specific content requirements when prioritizing the development of templates.
Start with the Login and Registration pages, as they are essential for all user types.
Then, prioritize templates based on the user type that will primarily interact with them (e.g., prioritize the Course Creation Page for teachers).
Test the functionality of each template with different user types to ensure that the content is displayed correctly for each user role.
