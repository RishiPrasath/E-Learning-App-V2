Secondary Colors:

#BFD8AF: A lighter shade of green that complements the primary color. It adds depth and variety to the color palette, suitable for background elements, card overlays, or subtle accents.

#D4E7C5: A soft, muted green tone that enhances color harmony. It can be applied to secondary UI elements, tooltips, or dividers, maintaining visual consistency and cohesion.

#E1F0DA: The lightest shade in the palette, providing contrast against darker elements and ensuring readability. Ideal for backgrounds, input fields, or areas requiring a clean, airy aesthetic.

Navbar Color:
Derived from the darkest color in the palette, this slightly darker shade adds depth and distinction to the navigation bar. It ensures visual consistency while offering a subtle contrast for navigation elements.

UX Element Coloring:

Buttons: Primary actions such as "Sign Up" or "Enroll" will feature the primary color (#99BC85) for maximum visibility and emphasis. Secondary buttons may utilize lighter shades from the palette for differentiation.

Icons: Icons will be designed using shades from the color palette, ensuring consistency with the overall UI design. Additional visual cues such as border strokes or shadows will enhance icon visibility where necessary.
