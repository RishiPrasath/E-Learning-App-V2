RBAC Implementation for Educational Platform

1. Identify User Roles

Students: Can enroll, view materials, submit work
Teachers: Can create/manage courses, view progress, post updates
Administrators: Full system control, user management, etc.

2. Define Role Permissions

Students
Enroll in courses
View course materials
Submit assignments
Provide course feedback
Teachers
Create courses
Edit/delete their own courses
Upload course materials
View student progress (grades, submissions)
Post announcements
Administrators
All teacher permissions
Create/delete user accounts
Modify user roles
Manage overall course catalog
System-wide settings

3. Map Permissions to Pages/Features

Course Creation Page: Teachers only
Enrollment Page: Students only
Course Dashboard:
Students: View materials, assignments, their grades
Teachers: Manage materials, view/grade submissions, announcements
User Management: Administrators only

4. Implement Authentication and Authorization

Authentication: Username/password, email verification, etc.
Authorization:
Framework-specific tools or libraries (depending on your programming language/environment)
Middleware/route guards to protect specific pages/features based on role
Store user roles in the database

5. Handle Role-Specific Behaviors

Dynamically show/hide elements on pages based on user role
Separate dashboards or navigation for different roles

6. Testing and Refinement

Create test accounts for each role
Thoroughly test all features from each role's perspective
Adjust permissions as needed

7. Documentation and Training

Clear documentation of role permissions
Guides for administrators on managing RBAC
Onboarding/help for users to understand their capabilities
Notes:

This is a simplified example; real-world RBAC can get more complex.
Consider how roles might overlap (e.g., teaching assistants?)
Be mindful of the "principle of least privilege" â€“ give users only the absolute minimum permissions they need.
